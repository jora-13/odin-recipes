        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an authentic sweet tamale recipe (tamales dulces de pina) with canned pineapple, 
            butter, and shortening in the masa dough. They taste delicious and will melt in your 
            mouth.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>corn husks</li>
            <li>2 pounds of fresh corn masa dough</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons warm water, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable shortening, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 can pineapple, drained and finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place corn husks in a bowl, cover with boiling water, and soak for 30 to 60 
                minutes. Drain, place on a work surface, and cover with a clean, damp towel.
            </li>
            <li>
                While corn husks are soaking, combine masa dough, baking soda, and water in a
                bowl. Knead until dough has a smooth and even consistency, adding more water, 1 
                teaspoon at a time, as needed. Take care not to add too much water. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat butter, vegetable shortening, and sugar together in a second bowl with an 
                electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Slowly add masa dough and knead until 
                mixture has a uniform consistency. Mix in chopped pineapple. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread about 1 tablespoon masa mixture onto a corn husk. Fold the bottom of the 
                husk over the filling, then fold sides of husk together, one over the other. Finally fold 
                the top of the husk into the tamale, making a little package. Repeat with remaining husks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the 
                bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low. 
                Add tamales with the open side up and cook covered until filling is heated 
                through and separates from the husk, about 1 hour.
            </li>
        </ol>
